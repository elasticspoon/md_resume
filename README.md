## Customization

You can generate the default style sheet with `md_resume generate-css FILENAME`. The default style is extremely generic, which is perhaps what you want in a resume,
but CSS gives you a lot of flexibility. See, e.g. [The Tech Resume Inside-Out](https://www.thetechinterview.com/) for good advice about what a resume should look like (and what it should say).

Change the appearance of the PDF version (without affecting the HTML version) by adding rules under the `@media print` CSS selector.
Change the margins and paper size of the PDF version by editing the [`@page` CSS rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/%40page/size).

## Note

The idea for the project is based off of https://github.com/mikepqr/resume.md. I could not get python to play nice so I rewrote it in Ruby and added features.

## Development

No clue currently. I still have not written proper tests for this.
